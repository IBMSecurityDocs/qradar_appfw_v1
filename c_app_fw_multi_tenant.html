<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">QRadar®</span> V7.4.0 and
later includes support for multi-tenanted apps. A number of out of the box apps, such as Pulse,
Assistant, and Log source manager, can now be used in a multitenant environment.</p>

<div class="p">App developers are able to mark that their app is tested and works in a multi-tenanted
environment. You can support multitenancy in your app in two ways:<ol>
<li>The app is tested and works with multitenancy, but it is not multitenancy aware. When a user
installs the app, they are presented with the option to create a default instance. Users can select
this option if they only want a single instance of the app, or the app does not need to support
multitenancy. If a user does not select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Default Instance</span> option, they
must create a separate instance for each customer and associate each instance with a security
profile to keep all client data separate.</li>

<li>The app is tested and is multitenancy aware. In this case, only one instance of the app is
necessary. This type of app is also beneficial if the app is used only by administrators. </li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">Use the following new manifest flags indicate support for multitenancy in an app. By default,
these flags are set to false. 
<div class="tablenoborder"><table summary="" id="c_app_fw_whats_new_732__table_xxj_2dd_vkb" class="defaultstyle"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead style="text-align:left;">

<td headers="d26680e49 " class="tdleft"><code class="ph codeph">multitenancy_safe</code></td>

<td headers="d26680e52 " class="tdleft">If set to true, this key indicates that your application can work in a multitenant
environment. If not set to true, it indicates that only one instance of your app can be created, and
any user who is a member of a tenant is not able to see it. </td>

<tr>
<td headers="d26680e49 " class="tdleft"><code class="ph codeph">single_instance_only</code></td>

<td headers="d26680e52 " class="tdleft">
<p>If this key is set to true, only one instance of this app can be created. Typically, this
indicates that this application can either provide multitenancy support itself, or that use of this
application is meant only for administrators.</p>

<p>If the <code class="ph codeph">multitenacy_safe</code> key is not also set to true, then users who are a member
of a tenant cannot see this app. If <code class="ph codeph">multitenacy_safe</code> is also set to true, then all
users can see the app.</p>

</div>

<p>If the <code class="ph codeph">multitenancy_safe</code> key is not set to true, then <span class="ph">QRadar</span> assumes that it cannot
trust the app to run in a multitenant environment. This key indicates that only one instance of the
app runs, and that a limited set of users can access it. This setting ensures that users who are in
a tenant can't access other tenants' data.</p>

<p>The <code class="ph codeph">single_instance_only</code> defines how your app can operate in a multitenant
environment.</p>

<div class="p">If the key is not set to true, users can create multiple instances of the app. Set this key to
true if the app stores data locally, or if the app uses an API or other means of accessing <span class="ph">QRadar</span> that allows access to more
than one tenant's data, and the app cannot segregate the data itself. In this case, <span class="ph">QRadar</span> allows administrators to
create a new instance of this application that is tied to a specific security. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Example:</span> A customer who installs your app has a small number of users that use two
different security profiles: <var class="keyword varname">Electricity Company</var> and <var class="keyword varname">Water
Works</var>. When an administrator creates a new instance of your app, they must assign this
instance to a security profile, such as <var class="keyword varname">Electricity Company</var>. Then, only users
with the <var class="keyword varname">Electricity Company</var> security profile are able to access this instance of
your app. </div>
</div>

<p>Associating instances with security profiles instead of tenants gives users more control over
which users can access tenant data. A tenant is expected to have one or more security profiles
associated with it to define what data different users can see. </p>

<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> If your app uses an API key to autonomously access <span class="ph">QRadar</span> APIs, set up your
application to request authentication through its manifest. You can then define the exact access
capabilities that are required, and that key is delivered to your app securely as needed. For more
information on app authentication, see <a href="c_appframework_oauth.html" title="Apps use the OAuth authorization protocol to authorize the app to access QRadar resources.">OAuth app authorization with QRadar</a>.</div>
