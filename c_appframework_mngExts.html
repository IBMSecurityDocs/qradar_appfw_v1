 <span class="shortdesc">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Extensions Management</span> tool on the <span class="ph">IBM®

<p>Use the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> Content
Management Tool to export your application as an extension. Then, use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Extensions
Management</span> tool on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Admin</span> tab to upload, install, uninstall,
and delete it. For more information about content management and extensions, see the <cite>IBM
QRadar Administration Guide</cite>. </p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d34781e57"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d34781e57">About extensions</h2>

<p>Before you install an extension, the content items are compared to content items that are already
in the deployment. If the content items exist, you can choose to overwrite them or to keep the
existing data.</p>

<p>When you uninstall an extension, apps that are included in the extension are automatically
uninstalled. Content items that are included in the extension must be removed manually.</p>

<p>After the extension is added, a yellow caution icon in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Status</span> column
indicates potential issues with the digital signature. Hover the mouse over the triangle for more
information. Extensions that are unsigned or are signed by the developer, but not validated by your
vendor, might cause compatibility issues in your deployment.</p>
