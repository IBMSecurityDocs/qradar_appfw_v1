<h1 class="topictitle1" id="d6883e10">Source dependencies</h1>


<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If your app requires dependencies, such as RPMs or Python libraries, you can add them in
the <span class="ph filepath">src_deps</span> sub directory of the <span class="ph filepath">app</span> folder.</p>

<p>The <span class="ph filepath">src_deps</span> directory can contain these optional sub directories:</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d6883e32"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d6883e32"><span class="ph filepath">pip</span></h2>

<p>Use the <span class="ph filepath">pip</span> folder to install extra Python libraries. For example, if your
application requires the <span class="ph filepath">observable-0.01.00</span> Python library, add the
<span class="ph filepath">observable-0.01.00.tar.gz</span> file to the <span class="ph filepath">pip</span> folder.</p>

<p>Don't use .tar files for Python libraries that include extra C-based extensions. Instead, add
libraries as Python wheel files (<code class="ph codeph">.whl</code>), which have C-based extensions
pre-compiled.</p>

<p>You must install Python wheel files on the same system architecture they were compiled upon. To
work with <span class="ph">IBM®
QRadar®</span> application
framework, wheel files must be compiled on Centos 6.7 x86_64. If it uses compatible architecture,
you can use the Python <span class="keyword cmdname">bdist_wheel</span> command to create wheel files from a library's
source code on your own system. The command <code class="ph codeph">python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel</code>
creates the wheel file when you run it from within the root directory of the Python library's source
folder.</p>

<p>A useful alternative to manually downloading Python packages for your app is the
<span class="ph filepath">pip2pi</span> Python package. It requires <span class="ph filepath">pip</span> and you can install
it on your development computer by using the <code class="ph codeph">pip install pip2pi</code> command. After you
install this package, you run the following command:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>pip2tgz &lt;target-directory&gt; &lt;Python package&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For example, the following command downloads the package's wheel, along with its dependencies,
into the specified folder.</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>pip2tgz python_packages/pytest/ pytest==2.8.2</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="keyword parmname">pytest</span> parameter is optional and you can use it to download specific
versions of a package. </p>

<p>For Python libraries that have dependencies, you can include an optional
<span class="ph filepath">ordering.txt</span> file in the <span class="ph filepath">pip</span> folder to specify the order
in which Python libraries are installed. This text file must include the names of files that are in
the <span class="ph filepath">/pip</span> folder. File names must be separated with a new line (UNIX line
endings) in the order that you want them installed.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d6883e116"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d6883e116"><span class="ph filepath">rpms</span></h2>

<p>Use the <span class="ph filepath">rpms</span> folder to install extra Red Hat Enterprise Linus (RHEL) RPMs.
The RPMs must be CentOs 6.7 x86_64 compatible.</p>

<p>For RPMs that have dependencies, you can include an optional <span class="ph filepath">ordering.txt</span>
file in the <span class="ph filepath">rpms</span> folder to specify the order in which RPMs are installed. This
text file must include the names of files that are in the <span class="ph filepath">rpms</span> folder. File
names must be separated with a new line (UNIX line endings) in the order you want them
installed.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d6883e141"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d6883e141"><span class="ph filepath">init</span></h2>

<p>Add dependencies files that do not fit into the <span class="ph filepath">pip</span> or
<span class="ph filepath">rpms</span> folders to the <span class="ph filepath">init</span> folder. You must also include an
<span class="ph filepath">ordering.txt</span> file in the <span class="ph filepath">init</span> folder. The lines in this
text file (UNIX line endings) are run as shell commands during the installation of the app. </p>

<p>For example, you might want to install a collection of RPMs that has a complex dependency chain
that is not explicitly known. In this use case, you add a <span class="ph filepath">.tar</span> file that is
called <span class="ph filepath">dependant_rpms.tar.gz </span> to the <span class="ph filepath">init</span> folder. You add
the following commands to the <span class="ph filepath">ordering.txt</span> file:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>mkdir /src_deps/init/dependant_rpms</code></pre>
<pre class="codeblock"><code>cd /src_deps/init</code></pre>
<pre class="codeblock"><code>tar -xzvf dependant_rpms.tar.gz</code></pre>
<pre class="codeblock"><code>yum -y localinstall --disablerepo=* dependant_rpms/*rpm</code></pre>
<pre class="codeblock"><code>rm -rf dependant_rpms</code></pre>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The <code class="ph codeph">--disablerepo=*</code> switch in this example is used to prevent the
<span class="keyword cmdname">yum</span> from attempting to contact remote repositories on QRadar consoles that have
no internet access.<p>This example uses <span class="keyword cmdname">yum</span>'s RPM auto-dependency resolution that
installs a set of specified RPMs in the required order. If the RPMs are included in the
<span class="ph filepath">rpms</span> folder, you must specify the installation order.</p>
