QRadar®</span> V.7.4.0
introduces new features and enhancements.</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d5816e30" id="concept_xt1_tpg_2bb__wn_optimized_backup_recovery"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d5816e30">Run apps in a multi-tenant environment</h2>

<p><span class="ph">QRadar</span> V.7.4.0 includes
support for multi-tenanted apps. A number of out of the box apps, such as Pulse, Assistant, and Log
source manager, can now be used in a multi-tenant environment.</p>

<div class="p">App developers will now be able to mark that their app has been tested and works in a
multi-tenanted environment. There are two forms of multi-tenancy support in apps:<ol>
<li>The app is tested and works with multi-tenancy, but it is not multi-tenancy aware. When a user
installs the app, they are presented with the option to create a default instance. Users can select
this option if they only want a single instance of the app, or the app does not need to support
multi-tenancy. If a user does not select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Default Instance</span> option, they
must create a separate instance for each customer and associate each instance with a security
profile to keep all client data separate.</li>

<li>The app is tested and is multi-tenancy aware. In this case, only one instance of the app is
necessary. This type of app is also beneficial if the app is designed to be used only by
administrators. </li>

</ol>
