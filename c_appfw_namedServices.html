<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use the named services feature to define background processes for an app that other apps
and <span class="ph">IBM®
QRadar®</span>
can communicate with in an asynchronous manner.</p>

<p>You can write apps that define services and REST API endpoints that other apps can interact with.
<span class="ph">QRadar</span> data that is
manipulated by one app can be accessed, and represented, or reworked by another app. Information
that is generated by one app can be reused by other apps to add value to the original data. Your
apps are no longer restricted to working with the data that is provided by the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> REST API alone.</p>

<p>The named services feature also provides developers with greater flexibility when they want to
use web services frameworks. Named service processes do not need to run as part of the Flask web
service that is built into the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> application framework. You
can choose to install and use a different method (for example, Node.js) to run the named service
process from within the application container. The Flask process can be disabled by setting the
<span class="keyword parmname">load_flask</span> field in your app's manifest file.</p>

<p>If your named service defines a process, it can also define a port through which <span class="ph">QRadar</span> can communicate with the
service. If no port is defined, then the service is treated as a headless background process that
runs continuously.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Named-service-endpoint URIs are not constructed by using the console IP address. The
named-service-endpoint URIs display a relative path with respect to the console, for example,
<span class="ph filepath">/console/plugins/1001/app_proxy:resourceservice/resource/{resource_id}</span>.</div>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d6386e61"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d6386e61">How named services are defined</h2>

<p>The <span class="keyword parmname">services</span> object in an app's <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file is
used to define a named service. Fields within the <span class="keyword parmname">services</span> block are used to
define:</p>

<ul>
<li>The service's name and version. These fields are mandatory.</li>

<li>Optional REST API endpoints for the service. </li>

<li>An optional port number to which your background processes binds internally. For example, port
80 if you are running an HTTP server.</li>

<li>A command that starts the background process.</li>

<li>Supervisord configuration options. The <span class="ph">QRadar</span> application framework uses
supervisord to monitor and control service background processes.</li>

</ul>

<p>For more information about named service definition in the app manifest, see <a href="c_appframework_ServicesType.html#c_appframework_ServicesType" title="Defines named services, service endpoints, and supervisord configuration parameters.">Services type</a>.</p>

<p>For an example of how the <span class="keyword parmname">services</span> block is used to define a named service,
see <a href="c_appfw_tutorial_namedService.html" title="This example shows how to run a Node.js server as a named service with a single endpoint. The app takes data that is served from the service's endpoint and displays it on a new tab in the QRadar UI.">Named service sample app</a>. </p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d6386e129"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d6386e129">How apps communicate with a named service</h2>

<p>When you install an app that is configured with a named service, the service is registered with
<span class="ph">QRadar</span>. Other apps and <span class="ph">QRadar</span> can now make calls to the
background processes.</p>


<p>You can add a <span class="keyword parmname">named_service</span> field in any of the following app object
configuration blocks in your app's manifest file to use the service:</p>

<ul>
<li>Area type</li>

<li>Rest method type</li>

<li>Configuration page type</li>

<li>GUI action type</li>

<li>Page script type</li>

<li>Custom column type</li>

<li>Fragments type</li>

</ul>

<p>For an example of how the <span class="keyword parmname">named_service</span> field is used, see <a href="c_appfw_tutorial_namedService.html" title="This example shows how to run a Node.js server as a named service with a single endpoint. The app takes data that is served from the service's endpoint and displays it on a new tab in the QRadar UI.">Named service sample app</a>. </p>

<p>If you use a JavaScript client, the first step in this process uses a JavaScript library
(<span class="ph filepath">app/static/qjslib/qappfw.js</span>) that is supplied in the SDK. The library queries
<span class="ph">QRadar</span> for apps that implement
the named service.</p>

<p>For information on the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> App Framework JavaScript library, see <a href="r_appfw_JSLib.html" title="The App Framework JavaScript library provides helper functions for common QRadar calls that you can integrate into your own scripts.">App Framework JavaScript library</a>.</p>


<p>After all the apps that match the named service and version are returned, the caller can decide
which ones to call. Calls proxy through <span class="ph">QRadar</span> and call the named service
either directly, or via a port.</p>


<p><span class="ph">QRadar</span> uses the value in
the <span class="keyword parmname">named_service</span> fields to locate and register the named service that an app
object wants to interact with.</p>
