<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use <span class="ph">IBM®
QRadar®</span> apps
to extend and enhance your current <span class="ph">QRadar</span> deployment with new data
and ready-to-use use cases. </p>

<div class="section">
<p>A <span class="ph">QRadar</span> app is a means to
augment and enrich your current <span class="ph">QRadar</span> system with new data and
functionality. You can download and install other shared apps that are created by <span class="ph">IBM</span>, its Business Partners, and
other <span class="ph">QRadar</span> customers.</p>

<p>You create your own apps from <span class="ph">QRadar</span> by using the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> GUI Application Framework
Software Development Kit (SDK). You can then package the app and reuse it in other <span class="ph">QRadar</span> deployments. You can share
your app on the <a href="https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM X-Force Exchange</a> portal (https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/). </p>

<p>Apps provide new tabs, API methods, dashboard items, pop-up menus, toolbar buttons, configuration
pages, and more within the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> user interface. The
functionality is entirely defined by Python Flask framework apps that serves the app endpoints from
a secure container. </p>

<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> The <span class="ph">QRadar</span> app framework does not
support systems that are configured using the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG).
Customers that use STIG hardened systems can not install apps in <span class="ph">QRadar</span>.</div>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d3594e92"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d3594e92">Download public apps</h2><p>All apps and security product enhancements are hosted
on the <a href="https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">IBM X-Force
Exchange</a> portal (https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/). </p>
You can see a list of available

Security App Exchange</a> (https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub). Filter apps by selecting
the <span class="ph uicontrol">Application</span> check box. <p>Every download from the X-Force App Exchange is
known as an extension. An extension can consist of an app or security product enhancement (content
extension) that is packaged as an archive (.zip) file, which you can deploy on <span class="ph">QRadar</span> by using the
<span class="ph uicontrol">Extensions Management</span> tool on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Admin</span> tab.
