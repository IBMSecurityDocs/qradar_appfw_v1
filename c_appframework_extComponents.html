<td headers="d30362e68 ">Data</td>

<td headers="d30362e71 ">A set of search criteria (filters, time window, columns to display or group data by). By

<td headers="d30362e68 ">Data</td>

<td headers="d30362e71 ">A set of tests that are run against events or flows that enter the system. The rule is
triggered when the tests match the input. Rules can have responses which are actions that are
triggered when the rule is triggered. Responses can include actions such as generating an offense,
generating a new event, sending an email, annotating the event, or adding data to a reference data
collection.</td>

<td headers="d30362e68 ">Data</td>

<td headers="d30362e71 ">Defines a property that is extracted or derived from an inbound event or flow. Can be based
on a regular expression that extracts a subset of a particular event or flow payload as a textual

router, application, or database. Any events that enter <span class="ph">QRadar</span> and originate from that
source are attributed to the log source. Log sources contain the configuration information that is
needed to receive inbound events, or to pull event data from the event source. Log sources contain
information that is specific to your environment such as IP address or host name and other possible
configuration parameters.</td>

<td headers="d30362e68 ">Functionality</td>

<td headers="d30362e71 ">A custom response for a rule to run, when the rule is triggered. Custom actions are defined
