<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can attach scripts to custom rules that do custom actions in response to network
events. Use the <span class="keyword wintitle">Custom Action</span> window to manage custom action
scripts.</p>

<p>Use custom actions to select or define the value that is passed to the script and to
define the resulting action. </p>

<p>For example, you can write a script to create a firewall rule that blocks a source IP
address&nbsp;from your network in response to a rule that is triggered by a defined number of failed
login attempts.</p>

<p>The following examples are custom actions that are the outcomes of passing values to a
script: </p>

<ul>
<li>Block users and domains.</li>

<li>Initiate work flows and updates in external systems.</li>

<li>Update TAXI servers with a STIX representation of a threat.</li>

</ul>

<p>Custom actions work best with a low volume of events and with custom rules that have a low
response limiter value. </p>

<div class="p">Take the following steps to define your custom actions:<ol>
<li>From the Admin tab, click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Define Actions</span> icon.</li>

<li>Click <span class="ph uicontrol">Add </span> on the <span class="keyword wintitle">Custom Action</span> window toolbar to
open the <span class="ph uicontrol">Define Custom Action</span> dialog where you can upload scripts that define
custom actions. </li>

<li>Select a programming language version that the product supports from the<span class="ph uicontrol">
Interpreter</span> list.</li>

<li>Select and name a parameter from the following table to pass to the script that you upload.<div class="p">

<div class="tablenoborder"><table summary="" id="c_appframework_defineCustActs__table_lbp_hq4_hy" class="defaultstyle"><caption><span class="tablecap">Table 1.

<td headers="d28157e96 ">Values that are passed to the custom action script. <p>Not based on the events or flows, but
are based on other defined values that you can use the script to act on. </p>
<p>For example, the
fixed properties <var class="keyword varname">username</var> and <var class="keyword varname">password</var> for a third-party
system are passed to a script that results in sending an SMS alert, or other defined
action.</p>
<p>You can encrypt fixed properties, such as passwords, by selecting the
<span class="ph uicontrol">Encrypt value</span> check box.</p>

<td headers="d28157e93 "><span class="keyword parmname">Network event property</span></td>

<td headers="d28157e96 ">Dynamic Ariel properties that are generated by events. Select from the
<span class="ph uicontrol">Property</span> list.<p>For example, the network event property
<var class="keyword varname">sourceip</var> provides a parameter that matches the source IP address of the triggered
event.</p>

In order to ensure the security of your deployment, the product does not support the full range
of scripting functionality that is provided by the Python, Perl or Bash languages.</div>

<p>Parameters are passed into your script in the order in which you added them in the
<span class="ph uicontrol">Define Custom Action</span> dialog box.</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d28157e160"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d28157e160">Testing your custom action</h2>

<p>You can test whether your script runs successfully before you associate it with a rule. Select a
custom action and click <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Test Execution</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Execute</span></span> to test your script. The <span class="keyword wintitle">Test custom action execution</span> dialog
returns the result of the test and any output that is produced by the script.</p>

<p>Custom action scripts are executed inside a sand-boxed environment on your managed hosts. If you
need to write to disk from a custom action script, you must use the following directory:
<span class="ph filepath">/home/customactionuser</span>. Custom action scripts execute on the managed host that
runs the event processor that triggered the rule. </p>

<p>After you configure and test your custom action, use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Rule
Wizard</span> to create a new event rule and associate the custom action with it.</p>
